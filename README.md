# Orbital Mod Manager (OMM)

Orbital Mod Manager (OMM) is a modern, feature-rich mod manager for **Kerbal
Space Program (KSP)**. Designed to enhance the modding experience, OMM acts as
an **overlay** to **CKAN**, complementing it with advanced features for managing
multiple Steam game instances and improving overall usability. OMM is not
intended to replace CKAN but to work on top of it, providing additional tools
and a more streamlined experience for players.

Built with **React** and **Tauri**, OMM delivers a lightweight, cross-platform,
and user-friendly interface for managing mods and game instances.

## üöÄ Features

- **CKAN Integration**: Full support for CKAN repositories, allowing you to
  browse, install, and manage mods with ease while leveraging CKAN's powerful
  backend.
- **Multiple Game Instance Management**: Effortlessly manage multiple Steam game
  instances, making it easier to switch between modded and vanilla setups.
- **Backup and Restore**: Easily back up and restore game instances, including
  mods and save files.
- **Custom Profiles**: Create and manage custom mod profiles for different
  playstyles or game setups.

## üß© Compatibility

OMM is designed to work seamlessly with CKAN, ensuring compatibility with the
vast library of mods available for Kerbal Space Program. It supports both Steam
and standalone installations of the game, making it a versatile tool for all KSP
players.
